# With Gusto
## A food blog with music, a music blog with food
### Dedicated to my musical paramour, one Jonathan Richman.

## Concept!

With Gusto will be a blog dedicated to all of the things I love (with gusto), namely food, cooking, friendship, music, poetry, and Jonathan Richman, with room for potential random musings. I want to record the things that make my life great, and celebrate the people I think are great. It will be design-forward and colorful and weird, just like me. Sometimes I will interview friends and ask them about a recipe they love, when they cook it, and what they listen to while they're doing it. 

## Features!
- A cool, colorful, but *tasteful* home page
    - It has a logo and navigation to a recipes-only page, and an about page (which will maybe also serve as a portfolio? why not)
    - It has a hero-ish section at the top of the page describing what the heck is going on here.
    - There are cute "cards" which link to the posts, the most recent post will be a larger card. Maybe I want these to all be different colors a la the "Girls" title cards. They will also have a picture on them. 
    - Maybe a "featured recipe" section that loops through recipes?
    - Somehow I'd like to include the poem. Maybe on the left side in the background? MAYBE

- Each blog post will be a separate page, the url can be the slugged title. 
    - In my dreams, I'd like the post pages to have different colored backgrounds and font, matching the cards on the home page. Or maybe the font just switches black/white depending on the bg contrast.  
    - There will be a hero image for each post at the top, with optional additional photos sprinkled through the article.
    - If it's a recipe/cooking post, the recipe will be linked.  
    - If it's a friend interview, there might be a Spotify playlist embed.

- The recipe page will have a list of all recipes. 
    - Each recipe will have ONLY the recipe with a short headnote, because no one likes weding through someones life story to get to the damn recipe amirite?
    - Recipe page aesthetics tbd. 
    - Comments tbd.

- There will be an "about" page, and it will have a contact form for people to send in their musings.


Hello Everyone, it's time for poetry
I submit to you the following it's entitled:
"I Eat with Gusto, Damn! You Bet"
By one Jonathan Richman.

When I eat like I do it,
I use not fork nor spoon
No grace or culture to it
When I call my own tune.

For I eat with gusto, damn you bet
A regular K-9 cruncher
Except truth be told I'm sloppier yet
Than many a dog food muncher
I eat a pound I eat a ton
And no there ain't much I cuts up
And while I'm having merry fun
Bystanders puke their guts up.

The FBI sent someone by
Who handles health affairs
I had not finished my cream pie
When he chanced up the stairs
Why did he turn the other way?
Why did he leave so quick?
Will he come back another day?
Did something make him sick?

I eat with gusto damn you bet
A regular doggie diner
"No don't bring me napkins waiter sir,
Just bring some trash can liner."

Whilst wandering by a juice bar
I spied a tempting beverage
Since I would have been last in line
I used my fearsome leverage
For in my pocket was some food
Which I took from the wrapper
The patrons watched it being chewed
And of course headed for the crapper.

For I eat with gusto damn you bet
For gusto I'm the boss
For yay my nose it is in the salad
And lo my chin it is in the sauce
I eat with gusto damn you bet
We're sailing around the cape
"Keel-haul him," said the Bosun
"There must be no escape."

One sunny day in Paris an elegant cafe
A phone call there a phone call here
And the gendarmes took me away

I said "qu'est-ce qui se passe ici"
I said " mais qu'est-ce que c'est"
They said "Such eateeng eet ees creeminalle
And crime eet does not pay."

For I eat with gusto damn you bet.
My banner yay unfurled
My shirt is covered with mustard
And my hair with ketchup curled

Goodbye to Egypt, Greece and Rome
The ancient world goodbye.
May squalor be my summer home
And filth be my neck tie.

For I eat with gusto damn you bet.
Uh, And Uh, I eat with gusto damn you bet
My country tis of thee
I eat for social progress
I eat for victory

Somebody died who watched me eat
In a restaurant one spell
He woke up and saw me eating beans
And knew that he'd gone to hell

For Uh, "He eats with gusto damn we bet."
They're calling from the south
They want to stop my gusto
They want to close my mouth
"You eat with gusto, yeah that's great
Now let us off this bus."
Wait a minute I haven't finished eating up stuff yet.
"We'll call you, don't call us."
